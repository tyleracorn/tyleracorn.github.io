    <div class="row">
        <p>
            I am a geospatial analyst/amateur programmer with an interest
            in understanding and using uncertainty in spatial analysis
            and more general data science. In my past life my career started as a
            Mining Engineer where I spent over 6 years working for Newmont Mining
            in the Carlin Surface mine planning department (Elko, NV, USA). I left
            Newmont and completed a M.Sc. at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB, CA)
            where I studied geospatial analysis at the
            <a href="http://www.ccgalberta.com/">Centre for Computational Geostatistics</a>.
            <br>
            My research and post-graduate work has focused on my interest in understanding
            and using uncertainty in a geospatial analysis framework. In addition to my
            research, I worked with three other members of the research group to develop
            the python package
            <a href="http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/welcome.html">PyGeostat</a>
            to manage geostatistical workflows and to provide data visualization
            for geostatistics in a python environment.

            <p>
                Working at the University of Alberta in the
                <a href="http://www.ccgalberta.com/">Centre for Computational Geostatistics</a>
                provided me with an amazing opportunity to gain a practical and theoretical
                background in geospatial analysis. There are many exciting areas of research
                that are taking place in the CCG, all with expanding our knowledge on how to
                deal with spatial modeling of multiple variables to correctly account for and manage
                the uncertainty that is inherent in geologic data.

        <h3 class="text_center text_upper">Amateur Programming</h3>
            <p>
                As a self-taught programmer, my experience has been in developing within Python and
                Fortran. Most of my Python experience comes from developing (jointly with primarily 3 other
                student researchers) the geostatistical package "PyGeostat". Fortran gets me a lot of
                raised eyebrows. Yes fortran is still used today! albeit barely and almost
                exclusively in a academic/scientific programming setting. My thesis was based around
                developing an algorithm in Fortran for optimizing concurrently over many models to take
                into account uncertainty, all within the Mining/Geostatistical/Decision Making frameworks.
                I have since continued learning as a hobbyist to further expand my
                knowledge in programming and development.

        <h3 class="text_center text_upper">Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            As an Engineer with over 6 years of experience in the day to day operations
            of a major gold mine I developed myself both technically and as a leader.
            I am technically strong enough to help push projects through, yet with my
            calm and friendly nature I bring groups together into a well-rounded team
            to ensure goals are set and either achieved or exceeded.
