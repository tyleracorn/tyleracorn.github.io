# WHO AM I
I am a geospatial analyst/amateur programmer. I am particularly interested in understanding and using uncertainty in spatial analysis and more general data science. In my past life I started my career as aMining Engineer where I spent over 6 years working for Newmont Mining in the Carlin Surface mine planning department (Elko, NV, USA). I left Newmont and completed a M.Sc. at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, AB, CA) where I studied geospatial analysis at the <a href="http://www.ccgalberta.com/">Centre for Computational Geostatistics</a> . My research and post-graduate work has focused on my interest in understanding and using uncertainty in a geospatial analysis framework. In addition to my research, I worked with three other members of the research group to develop the python package <a href="http://www.ccgalberta.com/pygeostat/welcome.html">PyGeostat</a> to manage geostatistical workflows and to provide data visualization for geostatistics in a python environment.

# EXPERIENCES

## Geospatial Analysis
I have a practical and theoretical background in geospatial analysis gained from researching and working at the University of Alberta in the Centre for Computation Geostatistics research group.

## Amateur Programming
I am a self-taught programmer with experience developing in Python and Fortran (Yes fortran is still used today! albeit barely and almost exclusively in a academic/scientific programming). I worked jointly with 3 other student researchers to develop the python package pygeostat. I have since continued learning in as a hobbyist to further expand my knowledge in programming and development.

## Engineering
As an Engineer with over 6 years of experience in the day to day operations of a major gold mine I developed myself both technically and as a leader. I am technically strong enough to help push projects through, yet with my calm and friendly nature I bring groups together into a well-rounded team to ensure goals are set and either achieved or exceeded.
